# What is DevOps?

---

# Vagrant

* ```vagrant up``` and you have a virtual machine ready
* Check in configuration of your virtual machine
* Configure in Vagrantfile

[vagrantup.com](http://vagrantup.com)

---

# Vagrant usages

* Production-like environment
* Test everything on your local machine
* Isolated environment

---

# Excercise (5 min):

* Run ```vagrant up``` to boot up your virtual machine
* Run ```vagrant ssh``` to log into it
* Run ```ls /vagrant/```
* Run ```touch /vagrant/created_in_vm.txt```
* Find the file you created on you local disk

---

# Basic Unix/Linux commands

* ```ls``` List directory
* ```cd``` Change directory
* ```echo "Hey"``` Prints "Hey"
* ```touch``` Create/update timestamp of file

---

# Executable scripts

* ```#!/bin/bash``` Runs script in bash
* ```chmod 755 filename.sh```
* 1 - Executable
* 2 - Writeable
* 4 - Readable
* uga = User - Group - All

---

# Shell provision

* Make vagrant run a script each time the VM is created
* ```vagrant provision``` to run the same script again
* Must be repeatable (will be run multiple times by Vagrant)

---
class: small-code

# Example

```Vagrantfile``` is Ruby code!

```ruby
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "bin/test.sh"
end
```

---

# Exercise (10 min):

* Create a provision script that Vagrant uses
* The script should create ```foo.txt``` with some content
* Run ```vagrant provision``` to test your setup

[Vagrant shell provisioning](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/provisioners/shell.html)

---

# Multiple VMs

* Different configuration
* Different provisioning
* Create network for all VMs

---
class: small-code

# Example

```ruby
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  # Shared config
  config.vm.box = "devops-kurs"

  config.vm.define :web do |web_config|
    web_config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "bin/web.sh"
  end

  config.vm.define :db do |db_config|
    db_config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "bin/db.sh"
  end
end
```

---

# Commands on one VM

* ```vagrant ssh web```
* ```vagrant provision db```

---

# Exercise (10 min):

* Modify your ```Vagrantfile``` to create two virtual machines
* Use two different provisioning scripts for the VMs

[Multiple VMs](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v1/docs/multivm.html)<br/>

# Puppet

* Configuration management
* Infrastructure as code

---

# Puppet

* Platform independant(-ish)
* Supports Win, Linux, OS X
* Master - slave architecture
* Enforces consistent configuration across environments and servers

---

# Puppet mode

* Master - Slave
* Run once
  * ```puppet apply file.pp```

---

# Example

```ruby
user { 'smat':
  ensure => present,
}
```
---

# Example

```ruby
file { '/vagrant/testfile':
  ensure => present,
  content => "echo 'Hello'",
  owner  => vagrant,
  group => vagrant,
}
```

---

# Resources

* File
* User
* Package
* Service
* Host
* ...

---

# Excercise hints

* Create your puppet-file in ```manifests/```
* Run
  * ```vagrant ssh web```
  * ```cd /vagrant/manifests```
  * ```puppet apply <filename>.pp```

---

# Exercise (10 min):

* Use ```vagrant ssh web``` to enter your VM
* ```cd /vagrant``` to access your local files
* Create a recipie that
  * Creates [a user](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#user) ```bekk``` with managed home directory
  * Creates [a file](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#file) ```.bashrc``` in the user home directory
* Do next exercise

---

# Exercise (5 min):

* Configure Vagrant to run puppet modules
* Use ```manifests/default.pp``` as your root puppet recipie
* ```vagrant provision web``` should run your puppet recipie

}
```

# Exercise (20 min):

  file { '/etc/sshd_config':
    ensure => present,
    source => "puppet:///modules/ssh/sshd_config"
  }
}
```

```bash

# Templates

```ruby
class ssh::server($listen = '0.0.0.0') {
  file { '/etc/sshd_config':
    ensure => present,

```

---
class: small-code

# Templates

```erb
ListenAddress <%= listen %>
```

---
class: smaller, small-code

# Exercise (30 min):

* Create a Puppet resource to create a site/virtual host in Apache
* An example config-file is ```apache.conf``` in repo
* Apache loads all files in ```/etc/httpd/conf.d```
* Each site should have its own user, that can add HTML-files
* Each site should use its own port
* Create a ```index.html``` for each site
* Use port forward in Vagrant to forward new site to your machine locally
* Test that everything works

---
class: smaller, small-code

# Bonus: Reverse proxy

It is possible to configure Apache to forward request to another webserver. This is often used in test environments to let multiple applications share the same port.

Example: You have two applications:

* App1 on http://localhost:8001/app1
* App2 on http://localhost:8002/app2.

Apache could then let all requests to /app1 be forwarded to port 8001 and all requests to /app2 be forwarded to port 8002

---

# Bonus: Reverse proxy

* Create a Puppet resource to create a site with multiple reverse proxies
* Let ```/google``` on your Apache show google.com, and ```/bing``` show bing.com
